	The First step in writing polynomials in Standard form is to determine the order of the terms from Highest to Lowest degree.

	<p>What is the "Degree" of a term within a polynomial? The degree is determined by the exponent of the term. For instance, an x-cubed term has a degree of three, whereas an x-squared term has a degree of two.</p>
	<p>This means for instance that, if we had four terms, x-cubed, 3 x-squared, 10 x, and 5, that the correct way of writing this polynomial would be.
