	<h1>This section involves finding the zeros of a polynomial.</h1>
	<h2>Warning: This section will not go entirely in-depth in finding the zeros of a polynomial, and will take advantage of technology.

	<p>Let us use this equation.</p>
	<p>Equation: </p>

	<p>First, in order to determine possible zeros visually, we will graph this equation</p>

	<p>We are able to visually see that it appears that the graph crosses the x-axis at three points. X = -3, X = 2, and X = 4. To test this, we list the Coefficients of the original equation, and sequentially perform multiplication and addition to determine if the value is in-fact 0. Like so:</p>

	<p>Now that we've arrived at a Quadratic Equation, we have two options. We can continue to use Synthetic Division, or we can use the Quadratic Formula. For our example, we will use the Quadratic Formula:</p>

	<p>This leaves our zeros as x = -3, x = 2, x = 4, and the factors of this equation as (x-2)(x-4)(x+3).</p>
